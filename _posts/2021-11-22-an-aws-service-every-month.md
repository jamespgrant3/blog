### An AWS Service Every Month
As hours turn into days, and days turn into weeks...I find myself learning a lot. However, there are some core services within AWS that I should know, but don't. Maybe I know more than I think I know, but I won't know until I do a deep dive.

So starting December 1, I will do a deep dive on an aws service every month, focusing on the fundamentals: compute, storage, database, networking & security. A goal being to post something interesting about the service as I learn throughout the week. Some services, like KMS, I might double up with another service I could learn in 2 weeks.

I will read mostly from the aws docs, and attempt to cover pricing and service limits as well.

Where to start? Such a hard question to answer, with so many great services to choose from. ec2 is so interesting, but it's a HUGE undertaking. I think a valuable quick hit would be [Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html).

Looking forward to 12/1!!
