### practice: eks
I was speaking to a good friend of mine this weekend, and he had a brilliant idea....as he always does. He recommended that I not only blog tech things, but that I actually DO some tech things, and talk about it.

As we're talking, my brain is thinking about all the possibilities. I quickly landed on EKS. I had an early love for k8s. Every time I have had an opportunity to interact with it, it's been abstracted away from me.

My goal is to use cloudformation, and only focus on the cloud. I am  not worried about pipelines, or the cleanest of typescripts. All the code will be in one repository, so you should be able to easily recreate the infrastructure and hopefully learn from it. I will try to script out as much as I can, to remove some of the tediousness.

Rather than individual posts throughout the learning, I will continue to update this post.

Today, I created an [eks-practice](https://github.com/jamespgrant3/eks-practice) repository. I did steal some yaml to scaffold out the vpc, but other than that I plan on writing everything.
