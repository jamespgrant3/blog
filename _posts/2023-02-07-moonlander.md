### moonlander
Today, I received a new toy, the [moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander). Wow, it is amazing!!! I feel like I am learning vim all over again. I only have my `tmux` shortcut key programmed, but I am already so productive.

I think my biggest hurdle right now is that I was a right-handed space presser, now the space bar is exclusively on the left. While I could remap the key, I think I like the default mappings. The columnar layout is also taking some getting used to. I give it a week and I will be good.

I will say this though, I rarely wanted to leave the keyboard before. I would look for shortcut keys ALL THE TIME. Now, I absolutely NEVER want to leave the keyboard...it's that bad.
