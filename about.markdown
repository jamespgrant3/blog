I am currently working as a Platform Architect with a fintech company here in Richmond, VA. I am a husband to one, and a father to four.

I started my tech career back in 2008, as a .NET developer with absolutely **NO** interests in JavaScript or front-end development. The love was destined to be and in 2012 I started front-end development, primary using Angular and React. As most JS folks do, I shifted backend interests to Node and quickly found myself doing full-stack JS development for many years.

Once Covid hit, I took the opportunity to learn something new. Up until then, the cloud was a black box to me. As developers were starting to be required to know more about the infrastructure in which they were deploying code to, this black box became more intersting to me. I dove in, learned as much as I could as fast as I could. Subscribed to blogs, podcasts, and followed any and everyone I could find on twitter.

Writing IaC and seeing object deployed to the cloud, did what taking mockups to workable fully featured web pages once did to me. I still enjoy writing software, but cloud architecture is where my little heart is these days.

As a test to my learnings, I obtained the Solutions Architect Associate certification in November of 2021.
