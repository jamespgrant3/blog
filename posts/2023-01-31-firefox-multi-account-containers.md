Ever had the need to be in several aws consoles at the same time? As you toggle between the two browser windows, or tabs, frustration grows because your last session seems to follow you between tabs!?

So frustrating!!!

Try the firefox multi-account containers extension, it is the only reason I switched to firefox when doing work within aws. Maybe chrome has a similar plugin, but I have yet to see it.

This plugin allows you to create a container per aws environment. When you login to the aws console within a given container, storage and cookies are isolated from all the other containers.

This allows for seamless connectivity between accounts. Give it whirl, you can thank me later.
