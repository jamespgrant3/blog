I'm hoping that with this blog I can help document, and hopefully retain, some of my cloud learnings in my quest to cure myself of imposter syndrome.

The goal is to post every weekday? Posts can range from frustrations I have encountered while working in the cloud, to cool things that I have learned along the way.

I hope you can learn from, or with, me.
