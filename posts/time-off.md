I was heavily devoted to sharing my findings, and then it just 100% stopped. Well, first...I went on vacation to Guatemala for the month of December. I have been struggling to get back in the groove ever since.

The real challenge has honesly just been juggling the time. Most of January was spent working and studying Spanish. However, I really want to devote some time towards blogging. It might not be daily, but a few times a week.

I started with a lambda deep dive, BUT, I really want to do something different. Ever since [this](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/02/develop-and-test-aws-step-functions-workflows-locally) announcement, I have been really wanting to learn more about [Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions).

So, Step Functions it is.
