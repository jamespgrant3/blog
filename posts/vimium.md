Here recently I have been really trying to maximize my productivity. I always try to get better, but recently it's almost obsessive! I found Vimium.

If you love vim, try it. It's a browser extension that allows you to use vim keystrokes as you do in vim, to navigate the browser. I absolutely love it.

I won't bore you with the keystrokes, but once you install it just use `?` to see all its possibilities.

That's all, I just wanted to share that tidbit.
